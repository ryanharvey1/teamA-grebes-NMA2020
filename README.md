Representations of self-movement rely on vestibular & visual inputs. Without these inputs, other modes of motor processing, which rely on motor efference copies or more noisy sensory feedback, may become engaged for representations of running. Thus, we hypothesized that a representation of running exists in visual cortex (V1) in the absence of visual and vestibular inputs and is stronger in darkness than when a static visual cue is present. 

We studied the running behaviour of head-fixed mice in a dark environment with and without a static visual cue, while observing the Ca2+ activity from neurons in V1, using the Stringer dataset. We performed correlations between running and Ca2+ activity, as well as other metrics, and found ~24% of V1 neurons were positively or negatively tuned to running. We then performed GLM with a L1 loss to decode running speed from the Ca2+ activity and found that running speed can be represented by ~300/12000 neurons. We found two subpopulations of neurons that correlated positively and negatively with running onset. Plotting these neurons in space showed that they are distributed in V1 without anatomical clustering. Performing decoding on light and dark visual conditions revealed that the decoding accuracy of running speed by V1 is reduced by visual stimulus.
